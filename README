Decorum
=======

Decorum is a simple tool which aims to make it easier to write flexible
and simple decorators. It can also act similarly to `functools.wraps`.

Typical usage looks like this:

    from decorum import decorator
    
    @decorator
    class my_decorator:
        def wraps(self, f):
            print "I'm returning the function! You can keep it!" 
            return f

Decorum makes lets you write decorators in a unified way. Your decorator can be
used with or without arguments, called or not, and it will work the same way.

    @my_decorator
    def foo(x): print x
    
Is identical to:

    @my_decorator()
    def foo(x): print x

Writing decorators
==================

Decorum provides two easy ways to write your own decorators. You can use `decorum.decorator` to
decorate decorator classes, or you can directly subclass decorum.Decorum. There are only
two methods to be aware of when writing your own decorators. Define a `wraps` method to handle
the actual decoration and return the decorated function, and optionally define an `init` method
to handle any arguments you want to accept, and handle basic setup (it's called before decoration
by `__init__`, you can use it in a similar fashion to a real `__init__` method). By default
decorum will try to keep assign certain attributes to the wrapped function for you, namely `__doc__`
and `__name__`. You can set `keep_attrs` to None to turn this off, or provide it with a list of
attributes you want applied to the returned decorated function.

Here is a slightly fancier example:
    
    from decorum import decorator
    
    @decorator
    class fancy:
        def init(self, arg=None):
            self.arg = arg
    
        def wraps(self, f):
            if self.arg:
                def newf():
                    print self.arg
            else:
                def newf():
                    print 'wut'
            return newf
    
    @fancy
    def foo():
        pass
    foo()
    
    @fancy('woof')
    def foo():
        pass
    foo()
    
    # prints
    wut
    woof
